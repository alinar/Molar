To install the Molar package, you first need to install "vtk" package. Either you can compile and install the source code while 
having CMake to provide wrapping for python or alternatively install vtkpython (https://www.vtk.org/download/). 

You can install Molar simply by the command:
pip install git+https://github.com/alinar/Molar
