To install the Molar package, you first need to install "vtk" package through 
one of these ways:
1. pip install vtk
2. compile and install the source code (from https://www.vtk.org/download/) while
having CMake to provide wrapping for python.
3. install vtkpython (from https://www.vtk.org/download/) and use it instead of python. 

You can install Molar simply by executing the command:
pip install git+https://github.com/alinar/Molar
